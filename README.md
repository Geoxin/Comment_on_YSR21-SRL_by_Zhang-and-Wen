# Comment on YSR21-SRL by Zhang and Wen
---
* __Note on Fig. A3a,b in this comment and dt measurements in YSR21:__
    Fig. A3a,b uses waveforms after removal of their __respective__ instruments for differential travel time measurement, and is the correct way to do it. In the present case, the OBN instrument responses __changed between D2 doublet (during 1993-2004)__ and using the data without removal of instrument responses would result in an incorrect measurement with an error of __about 90 ms__. If the initial YSR21's reported differential travel time measurement of -2.251 s was done using the waveforms without removal of instrumental responses and the actual differential travel time was corrected for the effect of the instrument responses later, then YSR21's reported OBN clock error will no longer be reproduced based on the corrected D2 doublet parameters in YSR23-errata (the reported clock error and the prediction would be off by about 90 ms). YSR21's reported OBN clock error can only be reproduced based on the corrected D2 doublet parameters in YSR23-errata and the initial YSR21's reported differential travel time measurement of -2.251 s without any further correction.
